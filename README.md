# Score card module

## Overview

This project entails the frontend design of a scorecard module, comprised of two fundamental pallets. The first pallet is dedicated to displaying the user's score and relative performance in comparison to other test-takers. The second pallet is a summary module, providing a breakdown of the user's scores in various categories, assessing reaction time and memory skills through a series of tests. The outcome is presented in the form of a detailed scorecard.

It is noteworthy that this project is an emulation of the [Result Summary Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV) challenge. However, I have incorporated additional functionalities to enable visual effects when the user hovers over the elements or interacts with the provided buttons.
